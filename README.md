# Diabetes-Outcome-Prediction
Analysis and Prediction of Diabetes Outcome with machine learning and deep learning approach 

## Objective 
To correclty (or atleast some times) predict diabetes outcome for a person or a patient given some of their medical attributes which is listed in selected in the report (included in this repo as .md file). The data set used in this analysis was already a clean data set with the recquired schema and thus need no or minimal data tidying or cleaning, the report consists of the statistical methods used to select different features from the complete data set. 

## The Machine Learning Approach 
After some exploratory analysis with the selected attributes from the dataset, I applied some common ML algoritms (widely used for classification problems), though the models perform well and can be used for inference and base level predictions but a deep learning approach is neccesary as it can help us infere more about the data and give much better predicitions (more real world predictions)
